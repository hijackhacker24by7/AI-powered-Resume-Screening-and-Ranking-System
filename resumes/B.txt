Page 2: Abstract
Overview: Provide a concise summary (approximately 200–300 words) covering:

Problem Statement: Explain the challenges in traditional resume screening (high volume, manual workload) and the need for automated approaches.

Proposed Solution: Describe your solution—a system that extracts resume text from various formats using NLP, then ranks candidates based on their fit to a job description.

Methods & Expected Outcomes: Mention that you’ll use TF-IDF for feature extraction and cosine similarity for ranking, plus a rule-based component for capturing features (e.g., experience and skill matches).



Page 3: Introduction and Background
Introduction:

Discuss the evolving landscape of recruitment and challenges faced in manual resume screening.

State the objectives: automated parsing, ranking of candidates, and improved candidate selection.

Background & Motivation:

Mention prior work in automated resume screening.

Explain why a rule-based system combined with traditional machine learning (TF-IDF + cosine similarity) is an effective starting point.



Page 4: System Architecture and Methodology
System Overview:

Input: Resumes (uploaded in batch, in varied formats like PDF and text) and a job description.

Processing Pipeline:

Resume Ingestion & Parsing: Using PyPDF2 for PDFs and standard file I/O for text files.

Text Preprocessing: Lowercasing, punctuation removal, stopwords elimination (using NLTK), etc.

Feature Extraction: Converting text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF.

Similarity & Ranking: Calculating cosine similarity between the job description and each resume.

Output: Generating a ranked list of resumes.

Methodology Details: Explain how you will read inputs, preprocess text, extract feature vectors, compute similarity, and rank resumes. Include a note that additional rule-based extraction (e.g., searching for keywords like "experience", "Python", "machine learning") can be integrated to finesse the ranking further.



Page 5: Implementation and Code Overview
Environment Setup:

Primary Language: Python

Libraries Used: scikit-learn, pandas, NLTK, PyPDF2, and any others as required.

Additional Tools: HTML/CSS/JS for future frontend support.

Module Breakdown:

Resume Loader: Reads resumes from a specified directory. Supports PDF and text files.

Text Preprocessor: Normalizes text (lowercase conversion, punctuation removal, etc.).

Feature Extractor: Uses TF-IDF to generate vector representations.

Ranking Module: Computes cosine similarity between job description and resume texts.

Sample Code: (See below for a complete Python example.)



Page 6: Experimental Results, Discussion, and Conclusion
Results:

Show sample output (e.g., a table listing resumes with similarity scores).

Discuss how resumes are ranked based on their textual similarity to the job description.

Discussion:

Evaluate the strengths and limitations of using TF-IDF and cosine similarity.

Mention potential improvements (e.g., integrating more advanced semantic models like BERT or adding domain-specific rule-based checks).

Conclusion & Future Work:

Summarize the project’s achievements.

Suggest avenues for further enhancement (user interface improvements, support for more file types, deeper NLP analysis).





Additional Considerations & Next Steps
Rule-Based Features: In the future, you can enhance the system by adding explicit rules to detect keywords for skills, work experience, education, etc. For example, using regular expressions or NLP libraries to highlight terms like “Python,” “machine learning,” and “5+ years” could further refine the ranking process.

UI Enhancements: Although the current implementation is backend-focused, integrating a simple web interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (or frameworks like Flask/Django for Python) can enable users to upload files in batches and view ranked results in real time.

Advanced NLP Models: Later iterations might replace or supplement TF-IDF with transformer-based embeddings (e.g., BERT or Sentence Transformers) for capturing deeper semantic context.
